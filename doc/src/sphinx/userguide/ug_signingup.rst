There are 2 ways to login to Clowder. Through a third party application or a local account.

Signing up with a Third Party App
=================================

The first one is to use a third-party network, like google, crowd, facebook, twitter, linkedin. They are enabled in
some instances on Clowder, and you can ask your Clowder administrator to enable them if they are not.

Each Clowder instance manages its own user database, for example: https://clowderframework.org/clowder/.

If you want to login using this method, you can click on the Login button in the top-right corner as marked by a blue
square on Figure 1.

Login
=====

After that, you can click on the icon of the third party app you want to login with. I will use google as an example, but the process is similar for all the 3rd party libraries.

After clicking on the Google link, it will ask you to login for your google account, and on the first time it will ask you for permissions to get your name and email from the google account.
