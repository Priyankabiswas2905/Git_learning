Docker container to create a user account in clowder.

If no password is given as an argument the docker container will print a password. Make sure to copy this password since
this will be the only time the password is shown.

For example the following command will create an useraccount with email address (and login name) admin@test.com with
passwd testing0909. This will be created in the mongo database that is started with in the clowder stack. The network
option will make sure it can connect to the appropriate database.

```
docker run --rm -it \
    --network clowder_clowder \
    -e "ADMIN=true" \
    -e "PASSWORD=testing0909" \
    -e "EMAIL_ADDRESS=admin@test.com" \
    -e "MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/clowder" \
    clowder/init`
```

An example script that can be used to create a new user account with a api key that can be shared is the following:

```
#!/bin/bash

function sha256sum() { shasum -a 256 "$@" ; }

SERVICENAME="uploadservice"
KEYNAME="apikey"
PASSWORD=$( date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 32 )

URL="http://localhost:9000"
MONGO_URI="mongodb://clowder:27017/clowder"

USERNAME=$( echo ${SERVICENAME} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' )
FIRSTNAME="${SERVICENAME}"
LASTNAME="SERVICE"
EMAIL="devnull+${USERNAME}@ncsa.illinois.edu"

docker run --rm -ti \
  --network clowder_clowder \
  -e "MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}" \
  -e "FIRST_NAME=${FIRSTNAME}"  \
  -e "LAST_NAME=${LASTNAME}"  \
  -e "EMAIL_ADDRESS=${EMAIL}" \
  -e "USERNAME=${USERNAME}" \
  -e "PASSWORD=${PASSWORD}" \
  kooper/clowder-init

USER_KEY=$( curl -XPOST -s -u "${EMAIL}:${PASSWORD}" "${URL}/api/users/keys?name=${KEYNAME}" | sed 's/.*"key":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/' )

echo ""
echo "USERNAME = ${USERNAME}"
echo "EMAIL    = ${EMAIL}"
echo "PASSWORD = ${PASSWORD}"
echo "USERKEY  = ${PASSWORD}"
echo ""
echo
```
